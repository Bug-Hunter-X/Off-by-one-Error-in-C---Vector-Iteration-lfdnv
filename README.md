This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when iterating over a `std::vector`. The error arises from accessing an element at the index equal to the vector's size, which is one position beyond the last valid element.  The solution showcases the correct way to iterate, preventing this type of error.  The code uses a simple example to highlight the issue. The solution uses a safer method to iterate using iterators.
